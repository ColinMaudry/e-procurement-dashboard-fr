## Contribution guidelines

**master** is the production branch. All its content is merged to the **gh-pages** and the result that everybody can see at http://colinmaudry.github.io/e-procurement-dashboard-fr/.

**develop** is the development branch, where new feature branches are merged to.  

### Content of the dashboard table

- If you just want to add or modify the table dashboard, you can do so from the **master** branch

### Code

- Ideally, follow the [Git Flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) method
- When you start a new feature or fix a bug, please create an issue first that describes what you intend to do and why. In your commit messages, reference this issue (read [here](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/index.html#notifications), scroll down to "Reference").
- Start new feature branches from the **develop** branch, unless you want to fix a bug in **master**
